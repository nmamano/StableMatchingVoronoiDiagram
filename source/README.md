# StableMatchingVoronoiDiagram
Interactive visualizer of Stable Matching Voronoi Diagrams.

Used for the figures in the paper "Stable-Matching Voronoi Diagrams: Combinatorial Complexity and Algorithms"
and for the experiments for the paper "Algorithms for Stable Matching and Clustering in a Grid"

There are two versions of the code: the javascript version is a stripped-down version for a quick interactive demo. The C++ version has many more features, different types of diagrams, different algorithms, the experiments for the paper, and so on.
